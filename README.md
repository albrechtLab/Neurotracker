## NeuroTrackerSummary
NeuroTrackerSummary is a MATLAB file that reads and formats the data created as outputs by the included NeuroTracker software plugin.
Simply copy the 'NeuroTrackerSummary.m' and 'databrowseS.m' files to a convenient MATLAB folder in your operating system.  Run the code, and point the program at the folder with the outputs of the NeuroTracker software.
